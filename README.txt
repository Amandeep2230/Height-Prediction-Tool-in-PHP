This is a php based tool which uses two methods to predict the height of children. 



1. Based on Parents height-
It is a less accurate method and requires height of parents only.


2. Based on height of parents and grandparents- 
It is a more accurate method and it requires height of parents and grandparents(both father and mother's side).
